# EvolutionEquipment

## Enemies get an equipment with the Artifact of Evolution and in Simulacrum

Includes various options, such as blacklisting certain equipment/enemies, defining different conditions for each monster category to activate their equipment, and rerolling for a Lunar Equipment with Eulogy Zero.

The behaviour is always enabled with the Artifact of Evolution, but it is toggleable for Simulacrum.

### Notes

- Any characters without an EquipmentSlot will still not use any equipment.
- Any Master ai that already has a behaviour to activate their equipment will not be affected by any config thresholds.
- Any mod that grants equipment on character spawn via a custom way may end up not being detected and can be overwritten by this mod. Give me a shout if you experience this.
